# Golang Reload Container (GRC)

What it does? it basically just use to hot reload golang code inside container. Why inside container you may ask, because it gave the code consistet resault across the environment and it more contain inside the container, also you can do many cool things with docker voulme, docker network, etc. I like to use this via docker compose, i just dont like to rebuild and rebuild this image so i make it prebuild image.
